# Vivel mobile app

## Useful application information

- for app to function properly you will have to add a `mapbox api key`

- active drives are displayed based on users current location (30 km radius)

- user can apply for a drive if the following conditions are met:
    - currently has no pending donation requests (user can only have one pending request)
    - if the drive bloodtype matches the users blood type
        - if users bloodtype is verified (one donation was approved, or hospital staff added bloodtype to user), user can only apply for bloodtype matched drives
        - if users bloodtype is not yet verified he can apply for any drive
    - if thereâ€™s been atleast 3 months since the last donation

- notifications are sent in 5 cases:
    - successfully applied to donation
    - donation scheduled by hospital staff
    - donation approved
    - donation rejected
    - drive open in the vicinity (30 km radius)
